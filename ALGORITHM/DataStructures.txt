##STACK
1. It allow access one element at a time. When an element is removed than you access next one
2. LIFO
3. Example1: when you take your letters from post box you verify them one by one from the top. So, you take first the late arrived emails
    note: if a person take mails from the bottom  it's QUEUE, if prioritize - PRIORITY QUEUE
4. Example2: you have long running project A. You boss came and asked do a report, you started to report then you got a call. You stopped doing report and answered call. It's a example of QUEUE (LIFO)

PUSH- put elements on the top of stack
POP - remove elements from the top of stack
PEEK - read element from the top without removing


##QUEUE
Queue is a linear data structure which follows particaular order in which the operations are performed- FIFO
for Queue is used old terminology compared to stack
ENQUEUE - insert element into the front (head) of queue. If the Queue is empty then it throws overflow condition
DEQUEU - remove element from the rear (end) of queue
FRONT - head of queue
REAR - end of queue

#Examples - 1. when resource is shared among accrossed multiple resources like CPU, Scheduling
#CIRQULAR QUEUE = RING BUFFER - to aviod problem when you can not insert more items in the queue when it is not full Rear and Front WRAPS AROUND to the beginning of array
