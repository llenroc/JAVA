    replace None with previous list item. this tricked me little bit and took some time to solve. [She asked me not to update the existing list instead create new one]
        [None] ==> [None]
        [] ==> []
        [None,1,2] ==> [None,1,2]
        [2,None,3] ==> [2,2,3]
        [2,3,None,None,3] ==> [2,3,3,3]
    Print the part of the array of numbers

    1) Print Max element of a given list
        https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/
    2) Print median of a given list
    3) Print the first nonrecurring element in a list
        https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/
    4) Print the most recurring element in a list
        https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/        
    5) Greatest common Factor
        https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/discuss/175845/C%2B%2BJavaPython-Greatest-Common-Divisor/182197/
    Given two lists, find the uncommon words.

Strings
    Recursively parse a string for a pattern that can be either 1 or 2 characters long.
        https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/
    count the number of times a character appears in a string
        find given char in string ( i did with for loop instead of count() or counter)
        find s in missisipi
        returns the number of times a given character occurs in the given string 
            s1='missisipi'        
    Count the number of times a substring appear in a string
    Check the substring in the string
    count each letter from a string
    compare two string and find the word only in one string

    Average length of letters to words.
        some of the edge cases are having spaces in the beginning and end of the words, 
        returning a float instead of int, 
        returning None for blank input.

    Given two sentences, you have to print the words those are not present in either of the sentences.(If one word is present twice in 1st sentence but not present in 2nd sentence then you have to print that word too)
    3. Complete a function that returns a list containing all the mismatched words (case sensitive) between two given input strings 
        # For example: # - string 1 : "Firstly this is the first string" 
        # - string 2 : "Next is the second string" 
        # # - output : ['Firstly', 'this', 'first', 'Next', 'second']

Dicts / Hash maps    
    Find the nth highest value given an unsorted dict. 
    Given a ´dictionary, print the key for nth highest value present in the dict. If there are more than 1 record present for nth highest value then sort the key and print the first one.

    Flatten a nested dictionary
        initial_dictionary {'geeks': {'Geeks': {'for': 7}}, 'Geeks': {'for': {'geeks': 4, 'for': 1}}, 'for': {'geeks': {'Geeks': 3}}}
        final_dictionary {'Geeks_for_for': 1, 'geeks_Geeks_for': 7, 'for_geeks_Geeks': 3, 'Geeks_for_geeks': 4}

Misc

    Given an IP address as an input string, validate it and return True/False
        https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-ip-address/

        Valid ip address, edge case to remember is if there are alphanumeric characters.
        validate ip adress (like if it has 4 parts, with numeric not above 255 so on)
    Given k numbers which are less than n, return the set of prime numbers among them
        https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/


    You have a 2-D array of friends like [['A','B'],['A','C'],['B','D'],['B','C'],['R','M'], ['S'],['P'], ['A']]
        Find with highest neighbors
        given a two dimensional list for example [[2,3],[3,4],[5]] person 2 is friends with 3 etc. 
        find how many friends does each person has.  
        note one person has no friends. 
        there won't be repeat relationships like [A,B] and [B,A] and neither will there be more than 2 people in a relationship
        
        Write a function that creates a dictionary of how many friends each person has. People can have 0 to many friends. However, there won’t be repeat relationships like [A,B] and [B,A] and neither will there be more than 2 people in a relationship

    
    Count the neighbors of each node in a graph. input graph is a multidimensional list
    Python graph node count
