/*
Example of TIGHT Coupling
Everything works fine. The problem starts when you need to add one more class. In this case you need to change you constructor of class [Manager]. 
It means the source class is very tight.  Itâ€™s not flexible and violate [open closed principle] of SOLID

To solve it you need to use interface
